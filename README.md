This repository contains two examples of social media analyses using webscraped data. The datasets include posts from Ben Shapiro's Instagram account and tweets containing the keyword "ATLA" (Avatar: The Last Airbender). The analyses provide both qualitative and quantitative insights, featuring a toxicity report, post frequency analysis, and topic clustering.


These reports were created and submitted for the class, "Critical Practice in Social Media," (DIDA-280A).
