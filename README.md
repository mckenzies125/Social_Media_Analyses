This repository contains two examples of social media analyses using webscraped data. The datasets include posts from Ben Shapiro's Instagram account and tweets containing the keyword "ATLA" (Avatar: The Last Airbender). The analyses provide both qualitative and quantitative insights, featuring a toxicity report, post frequency analysis, and topic clustering. 4Cat, Zeeschuimer, Communalytic, and Nomic Atlas were used in the creation of these analyses.


These reports were created and submitted for the class, "Critical Practice in Social Media," (DIDA-280A).
